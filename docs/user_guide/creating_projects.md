# Creating Projects

Projects keep related downloads and uploads together. Use the **Projects** link in the navigation bar to view existing projects.

- Press **Create Project** on the home page to generate a new project with a random HPC-themed name. You can rename it later using the pencil icon.
- Only one project can be active at a time. Click the pin next to a project to make it active before scheduling downloads or uploads.
- Selecting a project name opens its detail page where you can:
  - view and edit project information
  - create download requests
  - create upload bundles
  - open the project or metadata folder on the cluster
  - delete the project when finished (files already downloaded or uploaded remain on disk or in the repository)
