# Exploring Remote Repositories

You can reach a repository either by pasting a URL or by browsing from the navigation bar.

- If you already have a direct link to a dataset or record, click **Explore** in the top bar to open the resolver, paste the URL and press **Connect**. Loop analyses the address and redirects you to the appropriate page so you can start navigating immediately.
- To browse first, open the **Repositories** menu and choose a connector. Selecting **Dataverse** lists available installations you can drill into, while **Zenodo** presents a search form for finding records.

In both cases you end up on an interface that shows dataset metadata and files. Select the items you need and add them to your active project.
