# Exploring Remote Repositories

You can browse Dataverse installations or Zenodo directly from the **Repositories** menu. Choose the service to open its landing page and search for datasets or records.

Alternatively use the **Explore** option in the navigation bar. This reveals the resolver bar where you can paste a DOI or dataset URL. Press **Connect** to open the matching dataset or record page.

On each dataset or record page you will see basic metadata and a list of files. Select the files you need to download them into a project.
