# Getting Started

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `https://<ood-server>/pun/sys/loop`.
2. Sign in using your regular Open OnDemand credentials.
3. Familiarize yourself with the navigation bar. From left to right it links to **Projects**, **Downloads**, **Uploads**, and **Repositories** (Dataverse and optional Zenodo). The **Explore** link toggles a bar where you can paste a DOI or repository URL.
4. The first time you visit, an empty project is created automatically so you can immediately begin adding downloads.
