# Introduction

OnDemand Loop simplifies transferring data between your favorite research repositories and your Open OnDemand (OOD) workspace. The application installs as a standard OOD passenger app and is accessed at `https://<ood-server>/pun/sys/loop`.

The first integration is Dataverse which acts as the reference implementation. Other repositories such as Zenodo are also supported if enabled. OnDemand Loop is designed to keep your datasets synchronized so you can work on your HPC resources and push results back to the originating repository.
