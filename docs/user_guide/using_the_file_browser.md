# Using the File Browser

The file browser appears when you click **Add Files** on an upload bundle.

* Navigate directories by double-clicking folders or use the **Home** button to jump to your home directory.
* You can drag files from the listing onto the highlighted drop zone or double-click to stage them.
* Paths can also be dragged directly from the browser window.
* Click the pencil icon to edit the path manually or **Open in OnDemand** to view the folder in the standard OOD file app.
