# Downloading Files

1. After locating a dataset, select the checkboxes next to the files you want.
2. The **Add Files to Active Project** button becomes enabled when at least one file is chosen. Clicking it schedules those files for download to your current project. If no project is active, Loop creates one automatically.
3. Watch progress on the project’s **Downloads** tab or on the global **Downloads** page which aggregates tasks from all projects. Active transfers show a progress bar and can be cancelled.
4. Completed downloads remain visible on the Downloads page for twenty‑four hours and are permanently listed under each project with links to the saved location on the cluster.
