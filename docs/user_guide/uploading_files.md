# Uploading Files

1. Open an existing project from the **Projects** page.
2. Click **Create Upload Bundle** and provide the target dataset URL (for example a Dataverse draft dataset).
3. Use the **Add Files** button to choose local files. You can drop files onto the area or open the file browser to select them.
4. Once files are listed in the bundle, they will be processed automatically. Monitor progress from the **Uploads** page. Cancel or remove files if necessary.
