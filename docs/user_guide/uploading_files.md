# Uploading Files

1. From the project details page, click **Create Upload Bundle** and paste the URL of the repository location you wish to upload into. Loop analyses the URL and creates a bundle named after the repository domain.
2. If the URL points to a collection or dataset you will be prompted to choose or create the target dataset. The bundle stores the identifiers so future uploads go to the same place.
3. Each bundle requires an API key to push files. If none is stored a red badge appears with a pencil icon. Enter a key and choose whether to save it globally or only for this bundle.
4. Once the bundle exists, use its **Add Files** button to select local files. They are staged and uploaded automatically. Progress is visible under the project or on the global **Uploads** page where tasks can be cancelled.
