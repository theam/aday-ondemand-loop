# Viewing Download and Upload Status

Use the **Downloads** and **Uploads** pages to see progress for all projects. Each entry lists the file name, size and a status badge (Pending, Running, Completed, Cancelled or Error). The pages refresh automatically every few seconds and you can cancel running tasks.

Projects also include their own **Downloads** and **Uploads** tabs that show only the transfers associated with that project.
