# Supported Repositories

OnDemand Loop integrates with remote data repositories using pluggable **connectors**.  
Each connector manages browsing, downloading, and uploading data workflows.

Currently supported connectors:

- [**Dataverse**](#dataverse)
- [**Zenodo**](#zenodo)

### Dataverse
Dataverse repositories host published research datasets.
The connector supports public installations that respond to the standard Dataverse API.
You can find a list of known public Dataverse instances on the <a href="https://dataverse.org/installations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dataverse Website</a>.

**Explore**

- Paste a Dataverse, collection, or dataset URL in the *Explore* bar.
- Browse collections and datasets directly within OnDemand Loop.
- Search dataset files using Dataverse's API.

**Download**

- Download individual files from public or draft datasets.
- Public dataset versions are available by default. 
- Draft dataset versions require the presence of an API token.
- Files must be under 10&nbsp;GB in size.
- Checksums are verified after download.

**Upload**

- Requires a Dataverse API token.
- Upload to an existing dataset or create a new dataset inside a collection.
- Files are transferred using the Dataverse API and verified with checksums.

!!! note "Supported Capabilities"

    **‚úÖ Supported**  
    Fully tested and confirmed compatible with OnDemand Loop. Actively maintained.

    **üü¢ Minor UI Issues**  
    All core functionality works ‚Äî browsing, downloading, and uploading ‚Äî
    but some UI elements may be missing metadata or render inconsistently.

    **‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Support**  
    Core features like browsing and downloading work. Upload functionality may be limited or broken.
    Some UI elements may be incomplete or missing.

    **‚è≥ Testing Pending**  
    Detected in the wild but not yet tested with OnDemand Loop.

    **‚ùå Not Supported**  
    Known to be incompatible or out of scope for testing.

!!! note "Support for future versions of Dataverse"

    Future versions of Dataverse should suppport Open OnDemand Loop as well.

### Zenodo
Zenodo stores research outputs such as datasets, papers, and software.  
The connector supports the official Zenodo instances:

- <a href="https://zenodo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zenodo Production</a>
- <a href="https://sandbox.zenodo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zenodo Sandbox</a>

Zenodo does not currently expose a version number through its public API.  
We began testing and supporting Zenodo in OnDemand Loop as of **June 2025** and will continue to validate compatibility with future Zenodo API updates.

**Explore**

- Search Zenodo records from the *Repositories* menu.
- Paste a record or deposition URL in the *Explore* bar to view metadata and files.

**Download**

- Download files attached to a public Zenodo record or authorized deposition.

**Upload**

- Requires a personal access token.
- Uploads target a *draft deposition* (existing or newly created in Zenodo).
- Files are streamed directly to the deposition's bucket via HTTP PUT.

### Repository Settings

The **Repository Settings** section allows you to configure connector-specific settings for repositories you've previously used in the application.

Whenever a new repository is accessed, its metadata is saved automatically. This metadata includes the repository's domain and allows the application to store and manage settings such as API keys, which are specific to each connector. These keys enable secure access and streamline future interactions with that repository.

#### Repository Settings Page

You can access the **Settings** page from the **Repositories** dropdown in the top navigation bar. This page displays a list of repositories you've previously interacted with. If an API key was added for a repository, it will be shown here.

From this page, you can:

- View all previously used repositories.
- Edit existing API keys.
- Add API keys for newly used repositories.
- **Delete repositories** to remove their saved settings.

Deleting a repository clears its associated settings and credentials from the application. This can be helpful for managing outdated or incorrect configurations.

Configuring API keys ahead of time simplifies upload and download operations, particularly when working with draft datasets from platforms like **Dataverse**.
