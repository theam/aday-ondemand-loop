# Finding Data

One of the first steps when working on a project in OnDemand Loop is locating the right dataset — typically for downloading data into your project.
The application supports two ways of finding datasets from remote repositories:

1. **Using the repository website to browse and search, then pasting a URL or DOI in OnDemand Loop**  
   Best for advanced users who know where the dataset is located.
2. **Browsing and searching directly inside the OnDemand Loop interface**  
   Ideal for new users or those still exploring available datasets.

!!! note "Supported Repositories"

    OnDemand Loop supports downloading datasets from a growing number of repository connectors.  
    See the [Supported Repositories](supported_repositories.md) section for the current list. [Contributions to support additional repositories are welcome!](../development_guide/contributing.md)

    **Public datasets** with published versions are supported by default.  
    Access to **unpublished or draft content** may require an API key, depending on the repository's access policies.

### Choosing the Best Approach

| Method                          | Best For                           | Benefits                                             |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Paste URL or DOI**            | Experienced users, known datasets | Fast and direct. Leverages repository search tools.  |
| **Browse within OnDemand Loop** | New users, exploratory workflows   | Fully integrated. No need to leave the app.          |

### Exploring Remote Repositories

There are three ways to explore datasets from a remote repository when downloading data:

#### 1. Paste a Repository URL or DOI

If you already know the dataset you need, this is the fastest option:

1. Visit the repository’s website.
2. Find the dataset and copy its DOI or full URL. For example:
    - A DOI:  
      `doi:10.7910/DVN/MYSRMN`  
      `https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MYSRMN`  
      
    - A full URL from a repository:  
      `https://dataverse.harvard.edu/collection`  
      `https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MYSRMN`  
      `https://zenodo.org/record/1234567`  
      `https://zenodo.org/deposit/1234567`
3. In the **Explore** bar at the top of the app, paste the DOI or URL.
4. Click **Explore** to connect and browse the dataset locally.
5. From there, you can select and download individual files into a project.

OnDemand Loop will:

- Automatically detect the repository (based on the address)
- Invoke the appropriate connector
- Display the dataset’s metadata and file list

!!! tip

    This method is especially efficient if you're working from a publication, citation, or already bookmarked dataset.

#### 2. Browse and Search Within OnDemand Loop

If you prefer an integrated experience or are still exploring:

1. Click on the **Repositories** menu in the app.
2. Choose a supported remote repository, like **Dataverse** or **Zenodo**.
3. In case of the existence of multiple repository installations, select the desired one.
4. Use the built-in search to look for datasets.
5. Navigate the results and select a dataset to explore.

Once a dataset is selected, **OnDemand Loop displays its metadata and file listing**, allowing you to choose which files to download into your project.

!!! tip "Tips for Working with Drafts"

    - For **Dataverse** datasets, you can choose the dataset version — including the current `draft` — if available.  
      A repository API token is required to access and view draft versions.

    - For **Zenodo** depositions, a registered API key is needed to load any unpublished or draft content.

#### 3. Reopen Recent Repositories from Activity

Click the folder icon in the project bar to open the **Repository Activity** modal.
It lists repositories you've recently explored, along with shortcuts to explore them again or open them in a new browser tab.

!!! note "Repository Capabilities May Vary"

    OnDemand Loop uses each repository's **public API** to retrieve metadata, file listings, and search results.
    As a result, features such as search, filtering, and metadata previews may differ slightly between connectors.


### Launching from Dataverse

If the administrator of your Dataverse installation has configured OnDemand Loop as an **External Tool**, you can launch the application directly from the dataset page.

- Open a dataset in a Dataverse repository.
- Click the **Access Dataset** dropdown.
- Select **Explore in OnDemand Loop**.

This will open the OnDemand Loop interface with the dataset preloaded and ready for browsing or download.

!!! note "External Tools"
    
    This feature is only available for **Dataverse** and depends on the repository admin having enabled it. If you don't see the option, contact your Dataverse administrator.
    For Dataverse administrators: follow the instructions on how to configure [Dataverse external tools](../development_guide/dataverse_integration.md)
