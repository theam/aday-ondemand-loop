# Local Environment

The repository contains a Docker based setup that mirrors an Open OnDemand installation.
A `Makefile` exposes handy commands so you don't need to install Ruby, Node or any other dependencies on your workstation.

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- `make`

## Running the App

Build the application and start the containers:

```bash
make loop_build
make loop_up
```

Open the app at [https://localhost:33000/pun/sys/loop](https://localhost:33000/pun/sys/loop).

A test user `ood/ood` is configured. The environment uses a selfâ€‘signed certificate so your browser will warn about the connection.

Stop the containers with:

```bash
make loop_down
```
