# Introduction

**OnDemand Loop** extends Open OnDemand with an interface for moving data between your HPC cluster and remote repositories. The application is launched from the Open OnDemand dashboard (by default via **Files â€º OnDemand Loop**) and uses your regular credentials. When you first sign in, Loop creates an empty project so you can immediately begin adding transfers.

Projects keep downloads and uploads organized. Each project groups related files and provides quick links to monitor progress. The navigation bar offers access to your Projects list, global **Downloads** and **Uploads** pages, and the **Repositories** menu. Use **Explore** to paste a DOI or dataset URL when you already know exactly what you need.

Throughout this guide you'll learn how to browse repositories, collect data into projects, upload results, and return to the Open OnDemand dashboard at any time using the **Open OnDemand** link in the navigation bar. Loop performs discrete transfers rather than continuous syncs, ensuring reproducible, auditable steps for your research data.
