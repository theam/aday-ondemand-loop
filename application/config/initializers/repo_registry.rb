# RepoRegistry
#
# This module manages the loading, sorting, and registration of Repo resolvers.
# It dynamically loads resolver classes from the `Repo::Resolvers` module, instantiates them
# using their `build` class method, and sorts them by their `priority` method in descending order.
# The sorted resolvers are then made available for resolving Repo URLs.
#
# This module manages the repo cache used to avoid having to resolve the same domain multiple times.
